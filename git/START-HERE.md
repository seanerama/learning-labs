# Git Fundamentals - START HERE

Welcome to the Git learning lab! Master version control for network configurations and infrastructure as code.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This lab teaches Git fundamentals through practical network automation scenarios:

- **Part 1: Single Developer Basics** - Core Git workflow for managing network configurations
- **Part 2: Collaborative Development** - Team workflows and branching strategies
- **Part 3: Advanced Concepts** - Power tools, automation, and best practices

## 🌟 Why This Lab?

Git is essential for:
- **Configuration Management** - Track all changes to network device configs
- **Collaboration** - Work safely with team members on infrastructure
- **Disaster Recovery** - Rollback to any previous configuration

- **Automation** - Integrate with CI/CD pipelines

## 🔧 What You'll Build

Throughout this lab, you'll:
- ✅ Track Cisco switch configurations
- ✅ Manage multi-site network configs with branches
- ✅ Automate configuration backups with Python
- ✅ Implement pre-commit validation hooks
- ✅ Create a complete network change workflow

## 🎓 Who This Lab Is For

**Network Engineers** who want to:
- Track configuration changes professionally
- Collaborate safely on network infrastructure
- Implement automation and version control

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic command-line knowledge
- Familiarity with network device configurations (optional but helpful)
- No prior Git experience required!

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Read the quickstart guide:**
   ```bash
   cat QUICKSTART.md
   ```

2. **Install Git** (covered in QUICKSTART.md)

3. **Start with Part 1:**
   ```bash
   cd part1-basics/
   cat README.md
   ```

### Alternative: Jump to Specific Topics

- **Never used Git?** → Start with Part 1
- **Know basic Git?** → Skip to Part 2 for team workflows
- **Ready for automation?** → Jump to Part 3

## 💡 Learning Approach

This lab uses **practical scenarios** from network operations:

- Tracking switch configurations
- Managing configs across multiple sites
- Team collaboration on infrastructure changes
- Automated configuration backups
- Pre/post upgrade snapshots

Every concept is taught through hands-on exercises with real network configuration examples.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing this lab, you'll be able to:

✅ Initialize and manage Git repositories
✅ Track changes to network configurations
✅ Use branches for parallel work
✅ Collaborate with team members safely
✅ Resolve merge conflicts confidently
✅ Automate config backups with Git
✅ Implement validation hooks
✅ Maintain clean commit history
✅ Recover from mistakes
✅ Integrate Git into network automation workflows

## 📚 What's Next?

Ready to start? Follow this path:

1. **[QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)** - Install Git and verify setup
2. **[README.md](README.md)** - Complete curriculum overview
3. **[Part 1](part1-basics/README.md)** - Begin with single developer basics

## ⏱️ Time Commitment

- **Minimum:** 1-2 hours (Part 1 only, core concepts)
- **Recommended:** 5 hours (all 3 parts)
- **Complete mastery:** 5+ hours (with all exercises)

Take breaks between parts. Git concepts build on each other, so understanding Part 1 well makes Part 2 and 3 much easier!

## 🎓 Platform Focus

> **Note:** This lab uses network device configurations (primarily Cisco IOS) in examples, but Git skills apply to:
> - Any network vendor (Juniper, Arista, Palo Alto, etc.)
> - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Ansible)
> - Application code
> - Documentation and scripts

The Git commands and workflows are universal!
